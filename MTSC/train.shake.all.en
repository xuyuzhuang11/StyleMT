Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.
The moon is down.
You have little cause to say so.
Let us go.
Cobweb.
My back a 't' other side.
I was contracted to them both.
But here my father comes.
Nor you, as we are, loyal.
Where did you leave him?
Do, good friend.
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink?
My noble girls!
She has deceived her father, and may thee.
Lo, now, lo!
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua.
The Lord Mayor knocks.
Tis brief, my lord.
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
No, by my life and soul!
And so, my lord, adieu.
Come hither, fellow.
He replied, "Thou unpossessing bastard!
Your way is shorter.
He misses not much.
Slave!
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
In happy time, Iago.
Marian, I say!
And nothing is at a like goodness still.
Get me ink and paper, And hire post horses.
Oh, no.
Who is't that cried?
It does, my lord.
Why, Fool?
Hoyday, a riddle!
We'll wait upon your lordship.
Content with Hermia?
I, sir, am Dromio.
Alas the day!
A spirit, a spirit.
Mistress, we have.
O, you give me ill counsel.
What else?
I'll see no more.
Are you content to stay?
These are not natural events.
See what a rent the envious Casca made.
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
It is not day.
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.
Where's Publius?
As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup.
How dost thou, my good fellow?
Not I but my affairs have made you wait.
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham!
I never gave him cause.
Ay, ay.
Nay, then, Well, well, th 'event.
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Tush, Gremio.
Hark.
On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn.
Does any here know me?
And here will rest me.
Armed, brother?
Lie with her?
I am sped.
I am poisoned.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Why, she hath a face of her own.
I do not think there is any such woman.
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Have you no more to say?
Is Claudio thine enemy?
I will chop her into messes!
With all my heart.
Some god direct my judgment!
Madam, I am not well.
Let it be so.
Nor what I have done by water.
Here comes the Countess.
Thou hast not, cousin.
O, he is mad, Laertes.
Ay, but (by your leave) not before me.
It is a common thing, Ha?
Will Caesar speak?
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day.
Poor Turlygod! ""Poor Tom!", That's something yet.
To one of your receiving Enough is shown.
Nay, go not back.
Good now, hold thy tongue.
Sink Rome!
They are coming to the play.
Have patience and endure.
I'll have no halves.
I'll fetch my sister to get her goodwill.
Go to, then.
This, Cinna.
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
I can not tell.
Well, let it strike.
A privilege never to see me more.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
Avaunt!
Come, stir, stir, stir!
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
What will you do?
There, my lord.
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice.
Oh, help, ho!
Thou baggage, let me in.
Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
O my son, my son!
Is there division'twixt my lord and Cassio?
Free, madam, no.
Well, what was yours?
Your ear is good.
Why are you silent?
If any ship put out, then straight away.
Dead?
I would have you.
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
I'll not fight with thee.
I might have saved her.
I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.
Why then, lead on.
No more but so?
That shall be by and by.
I pray you.
Your Majesty came not like yourself.
Thyself shalt see the act.
Let us deal justly.
Ay, my good lord.
I do consent, Prick him down, Antony.
O ill-starred wench, Pale as thy smock!
Bring us the letter.
I have a wife, whom I protest I love.
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
I pray you, let me see it.
I'll look to like if looking liking move.
She false with Cassio!
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs.
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you.
Who wouldst thou serve?
You do mistake your business.
Dispatch., Enobarbus!
Give me my robe, for I will go.
By sea, what else?
Then God be blessed, it is the blessed sun.
Horns?
Or blesse was't we did?
The players can not keep counsel.
As he was valiant, I honor him.
Kill!
Go, vanish into air, away!
Not I, my lord.
Would I might But ever see that man!
Have the pioneers given o'er?
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
I have heard her swear't.
Oh, wretched villain!
You have good judgment in horsemanship.
O, cleave, my sides!
Now, fellows, you are welcome.
I shall do't.
Ay, my lord, this same.
Here, madam, at your service.
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
Do not think it so unwholesome.
She swoons to see them bleed.
Oh, heavy ignorance!
Are you wise?
Within this half hour will he be asleep.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
Somebody knocks.
Go, go, up to the leads.
He sought my life, But lately, very late.
You bring me out.
You must sing This nothing's more than matter.
May one be pardoned and retain th 'offense?
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
My good lord.
They stared, and were distracted.
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words.
Let's all sink wi 'th' king.
Dispatch.
I am sure I am none such.
Go to.
What, is this so?
Can you deny all this?
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
He is enamored on Hero.
What trade, thou knave?
Rise, and lend thine ear.
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
Why, ay.
The folly of this island.
You saw they speak us fair, give us gold.
Ay, lord.
What, are there masques?
Now am I dead.
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
Why, what an ass am I!
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
Therefore tremble and depart.
Know him?
How?
What says this leaden casket?
A strange fish!
I will be hanged else!
They will steal anything and call it purchase.
Know'st thou Gower?
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
Behold where stands The usurper's cursed head.
Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
This is the door.
Poor man!
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?
I am not drunk now.
Here you may roast your goose.
Wonder not Nor be grieved.
Ay, ay.
Away, go away!
You have too much respect upon the world.
Hail, king!
But small to greater matters must give way.
Saw you my lord?
Why no, boy.
Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
My gracious sovereign.
I am aweary.
Farewell, dear Father.
Not here in presence.
What's his fault?
This can not anger him.
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.
In nothing am I changed But in my garments.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
Boy!
Be attentive.
Committed?
O perdurable shame!
No words.
Come by and by to my chamber.
No, truly.
Give me some ink and paper.
There lies your way, due west.
Bring him silently.
In faith, my lord, not I.
Call in my gentlewoman.
Ah, that's a foul fault.
I have promised to make all this matter even.
Do it.
O, you are novices!
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
I fear thee not.
They steal hearts.
Goneril with a white beard?
Nay, then.
Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
Let's do so.
Well held out, i 'faith.
My life, sir!
Think'st thou I jest?
Everything is well.
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.
There's hope in't yet.
I am glad on't.
I like you lads.
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond!
Something we will determine.
Come on, sir.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
Cast on no water.
I pray now, keep below.
What news abroad?
Oh!
God save the king.
He were no lion were not Romans hinds.
Shylock is my name.
I will hence tonight.
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Drunk?
Madam?
Shall we sound him?
Behold and see.
This was the most unkindest cut of all.
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
The cause is in my will.
Hear the ambassadors.
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
He, sir, that must marry this woman.
Our troops set forth tomorrow.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
They can not budge till your release.
Why should she write to Edmund?
You are an ass, you are an ass!
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
Alas, he is betrayed and I undone.
Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this.
O lady, speak again!
Brutus speaks.
If he do blench, I know my course.
I have yet Room for six scotches more.
Are his wits safe?
It is a nipping and an eager air.
Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.
Yes indeed.
Therein our letters do not well agree.
What, we have many goodly days to see!
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
See where he looks out of the window.
I know you are of her bosom.
No.
A dry jest, sir.
Peace!
I ne'er saw this before.
We see it and will say it.
It's true, good lieutenant.
I hear it now above me.
Your brother Gloucester hates you.
Drink thou.
Give me mine angle.
The time to come.
Why, may one ask?
This was a merry message.
Chop off his head.
You the like loss?
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
I will proclaim my name about the field.
Awake!
I would I knew thy heart.
I will die, And leave him all.
There's strange news come, sir.
So said, so done, is well.
As mine eyes opened, I saw their weapons drawn.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
Do you come near me now?
O noble fool!
This the Dauphin speaks.
Why, what would you?
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse already.
I serve as good a man as you.
He named Sebastian.
All disconsolate, With Pindarus his bondman on this hill.
How shall we try it?
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge.
I told him you were sick.
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
I know his heart.
Stand close and list him.
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
Even so.
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright.
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear.
Methinks I hear Antony call.
Is thy name William?
Come, let me wipe thy face.
I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.
Adieu.
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance.
Therefore I do advise you, take this note.
Is not that neighborly?
Up.
I'll go with you.
Come, help to bear thy master.
Welcome, good Cambio.
How canst thou cross this marriage?
Fie on thee, wretch.
True!
Help, help, O, help!
How am I false?
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
Besides, they all are fresh.
Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio.
They are, my lord.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
I am gone, though I am here.
To't, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers.
Away with him.
Then bring me to their sights.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony.
What is the news?
Go.
My liege, They are not yet come back.
With drinking healths to my niece.
O sir, very well: here in your orchard.
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony.
I hear the minstrels play.
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly.
I'll come to him.
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
I warrant you, madam.
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
Yea, even I alone.
Sure it is hers.
If it will not be, I'll leave you.
I am your spaniel.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found.
I am sorry for thee.
Look, here I have you.
The gods reward your kindness!
Wherefore is this?
Well, do your discretion.
Who hath made this havoc with them?
Fly, masters!
Why, man?
I have a thing for you.
Truly, my name is Cinna.
There, where the torch doth burn.
God's arm strike with us!
Is this true?
So, This is to horse.
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
Why, would not you?
Whither am I going?
How long hath this possession held the man?
What is it that you would impart to me?
We'll lead you thither.
As wit and fortune will.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
What ish my nation?
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change.
There is no more to say?
And I.
I am for you.
Some wine, ho!
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
Tis fittest.
I shall not look upon his like again.
Good morrow, General.
You'll find it otherwise, I assure you.
Only I say Things have been strangely borne.
At your choice, sir.
But soft you, let me be.
See for the news.
Give me a torch.
Be happy.
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
By no means, sir.
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
Thou shalt be loggerhead., Good faith, 'tis day.
What is his name?
What, shall I find you here?
Not now to hear thee sing.
Ring the alarum bell.
Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!
See, here he comes.
Chill not let go, zir, without vurther'casion.
Well, in that hit you miss.
But do not so.
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.
Would I were so too.
And one Deformed is one of them.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
O Cassio, whence came this?
What are thy comings in?
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
Will you tell me that?
I do desire we may be better strangers.
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
Caesar.
Hail, King of Scotland!
A drum, a drum!
Am I a coward?
Do you not hear, fellows?
You have said, sir.
What say you, uncle?
At sea, I think.
Art thou his friend?
To bed, to bed.
Know you any, count?
Montjoy.
What's her name?
Let me speak a little.
You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?
I cry you mercy, uncle., By your Grace's pardon.
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant.
It is no shame.
This kindness will I show.
There's other business for thee.
Save you, friend Cassio!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
And your experience makes you sad.
The Duke in council?
Well, sir, then'twill be dry.
Go armed.
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me.
They must take it in sense that feel it.
Hast thou slain Tybalt?
Well, my lord.
Shall we part, sweet girl?
I pray you, fail me not.
The slip, sir, the slip.
Where is my lady?
Let's mock the midnight bell.
How?
Well, we shall sift him., Welcome, my good friends!
Let me deal in this.
My most dear Gloucester!
You will be whipped.
Tis neither here nor there.
Post to Salisbury.
And are not you my husband?
Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
Within this hour it will be dinnertime.
And here's a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal.
You are not, Cassius.
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood.
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
Let's see for means.
How now, cousin Hero!
No.
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him.
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?
Ha?
I must discontinue your company.
Tis expressly against the law of arms.
Draw, you rascal!
He will come straight.
There is no other way.
Alas the day!
What is it she does now?
Next month with us.
No, my lord.
But'tis not so.
But how did you desire it should be made?
Art thou a man?
My voice is in my sword.
Bellario greets your grace.
I warrant something from Venice.
Sir, in Argier.
Whither away?
What dost thou mean?
Brought you Caesar home?
Do you hear?
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
What would you?
Let th' Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking.
Thou know'st where I will tarry.
How's the day?
Villain am I none.
Hem them away.
What dost you mean by this?
Sweet marjoram.
Will you have her?
Not so, neither.
Not so hot.
As a friend or an enemy?
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present.
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
I prithee, be gone.
Here comes a messenger.
Friends, come hither.
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
Yet Edmund was beloved.
Come, some music!
He, sir.
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Sure ones, then.
How oddly he is suited!
Behold this man.
What is, my lord?
I am th 'unhappy subject of these quarrels.
With his mouth full of news.
What needs more words?
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The constable of France.
No slander.
First, he commends him to your noble self.
Here the street is narrow.
Speak not of Helena.
How, the nonpareil!
Myself have to mine own turned enemy.
I see these witches are afraid of swords.
Cross him in nothing.
Why, our battalia trebles that account.
Or does he walk?
When comes such another?
Come, Antonio.
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
And I beseech you come again tomorrow.
The interim's mine.
Do so.
Tis time that I were gone.
Nay, I am for all waters.
My lord?
And turns the sun to shade.
I warrant thee.
Do you mark that?
It is worth the pains.
Judgment?
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both.
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
I "an itching palm"!
It shall not need.
Ah, women, women!
By Jupiter, This shall not be revoked.
O thou public commoner!
The knave counterfeits well.
Impart.
Is't not the king?
Well, I can not tell.
Come, come!
Prithee, be not angry.
There is your money that I had to keep.
Transform me, then, and to your power I'll yield.
Till he come home again, I would forbear.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th 'arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
Well, let them rest., Come hither, Catesby.
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man.
And how doth she?
And speak parrot?
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
Soft, no haste.
She can not deny it.
Be curst and brief.
Descend, brother, I say.
My dukedom to a beggarly denier, I do mistake my person all this while!
Ha, ha, ha!
Where dost thou hide thy head?
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
I, madam?
Where shall we go?
Take them away.
I see thou know'st me not.
But there's more work.
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she, as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king.
There is means, madam.
He married but his occasion here.
Would not they speak?
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.
Let pity not be believed." There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamor moistened.
Sir, I bade them take away you.
Give me particulars.
Would Katherine had never seen him, though!
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made, And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked i 'th' heel.
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it.
True, noble prince.
What think'st thou, will our friends prove all true?
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
I will, my lord.
Go release them, Ariel.
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly.
Welcome, my lord.
Oh, the good gods!
Are you not well?
No, not an oath.
Stood the state so?
Fare thee well, nymph.
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
Hark thee, Clitus.
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." Must give, for what?
Well, heaven's above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
I am but hurt.
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
I know my lady will strike him.
Prison, my lord?
Is it not like the king?
Widow Dido" said you?
How say you, lady?
I'll send my prayers with him.
Not i 'th' stocks, fool.
Abide within.
I am very glad of it.
Here he is, here he is.
Under what captain serve you?
Tell me, Othello.
Draw and come.
Caesar?
What, with my tongue in your tail?
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing.
Hymen from heaven brought her, Yea, brought her hither, That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is.
Cassius, Be not deceived.
We follow thee., Juliet, the county stays.
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Let that suffice you.
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
The morning comes upon's.
To the health of our general!
Then he is dead?
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.
When they are in great danger, I recover them.
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.
The enemy comes on in gallant show.
Very many, men and women too.
Go to, go to., Come hither, sir.
Nor in thine, lord.
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, For here we need it not.
Why should their liberty than ours be more?
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.
Where is he?
He hath been a courtier, he swears.
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
Oh, I followed that I blush to look upon!
When was it she last walked?
Fair lady, by your leave, I come by note to give and to receive.
Come away, servant, come.
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
Why do you speak so faintly?
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies.
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.
Out o 'your wits and hearing too?
Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in your place again.
To me, sir?
I know not, sir.
What is my offense?
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
Why, there, there, there, there!
My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours, And never in my days, I do protest, Was it so precious to me as'tis now.
Therefore go with me.
Tis said, man, and farewell.
Well, I am sorry for your niece.
Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
Why, sir, cobble you.
You speak all your part at once, cues and all., Pyramus, enter.
God, God forgive us all!
Why, no, sir.
Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly, wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
Give him a halter.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!, why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.
Fine, i 'faith!
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
Our size of sorrow, Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it.
Iago.
Good my lord, enter here.
I am glad to see you.
By running fast.
Romeo!
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
I must fetch his necessaries ashore.
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
Be of good cheer, youth.
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no, So, thrice fair lady, stand I even so, As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.
When came this to you?
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
No, not tonight.
Sweet now, silence.
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.
Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the jack with us.
Shall Kate be my wife?
I will, my lord.
And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way.
Yes, that thou didst.
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.
I will kiss thy lips.
Keep thou the left.
As I intend to prosper and repent, So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms!
Good repose the while!
I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on.
That's a fault that water will mend.
I am unfit for state and majesty.
It is not day.
Ay, my lord.
What comfortable hour canst thou name, That ever graced me in thy company?
You are i 'the right, sir, 'tis for my mistress.
Vent my folly!
For the love of God, your help!
Is't possible?
And in part him, but, "you may say, "not well.
Or did I dream it so?
I confess the cape.
A dear happiness to women.
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands, and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
My noble lord, What dost thou say, Iago?
Still be't yours.
Say thou but "ay, "And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
My noble brother!
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds?
Why ask you?
How, in one house, Should many people under two commands Hold amity?
Villain, not for thy life!
I understand not, madam.
Master, master, look about you.
Ay, marry, is't.
Ah, my back, my back!
I pray you, tell it.
What is the course and drift of your compact?
Then take him up and manage well the jest.
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
I'll strike and cry, "Take all." Well said.
Richard!
But hear thee, Gratiano.
Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.
He is the general challenger.
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things.
Good sir, draw near to me.
His hour is almost past.
The better for thy friends.
I am a spirit of no common rate.
Fare you well at once.
Not in love neither?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o 'this fashion i' th 'earth?

What was he, sad or merry?
Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
He comes to kill my heart.
When did I see thee so put down?
O mercy, God!
So do all thoughts.
Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.
But what though?
You have done well by water.
I am not of your element.
And so have I addressed me.
Thou art not conquered.
Away with the dotard!
You slave, you cur!
Tis hot, it smokes.
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
You tallow face!
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.
Tomorrow, soldier, By sea and land I'll fight.
What though I killed her husband and her father?
O wonderful son that can so'stonish a mother!
Saw you him today?
Croak not, black angel.
He stays upon your will.
I will bandy with thee in faction.
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
I can not speak your England.
To answer that, I should confess to you.
Ophelia, walk you here.
It is no matter.
What speech, my good lord?
May we be gone?
And let the wise man fly.
O, good sir, I do.
I am even The natural fool of fortune.
Say, how is that?
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Avoid what is to come.
Come, let us to the castle.
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
I can not blame her.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
you know me well.
Farewell, good Strato.
Most true.
That's our offer.
A king, a king!
That is he.
His son is elder, sir.
I will fetch him.
I hear their drum.
Speak, Agrippa.
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
I will go with thee.
Adieu, Till your return at night.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
False, false.
Now, Signior, where's the Count?
Villainous whore!
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
Ingrateful fox, 'tis he.
You have obtained it.
Oh, are you come, Iago?
My old bones ache.
He says so.
My deeds upon my head.
His leg is but so-so, and yet'tis well.
But he sleeps.
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch?
No, Cassio is not killed.
Mock not, Enobarbus.
No, wench!
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.
Where hast thou been, my heart?
Yet hear me, countrymen.
Do not you love me?
Your will?
Well run, Thisbe!
Name them.
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
You say you are a better soldier.
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
What was the second noise for?
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out!
I will do't, my lord.
That's the end.
Tis true.
Let me come to her.
Taurus!
But who was this?
Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive.
Most sincerely.
Think of me as you please.
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
Well, but what's o'clock?
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
That will I, should I die the hour after.
Farewell, kind master.
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas.
And mine, to eke out hers.
I loved you not.
What, would you make me mad?
O thou pernicious caitiff!
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio?
You lie.
Thanks to your Highness.
Come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns.
Call, good Mercutio.
Go we to him.
Ay, that he was.
We have beat him to his camp.
Good morrow to thee.
Alas, and woe!
Tie up my love's tongue.
Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me.
God keep me so., Our heralds go with him.
Wrong I mine enemies?
You tremble and look pale.
But here comes Antony.
What is thy name?
I will do so.
Good morrow, friends.
When beggars die there are no comets seen.
Commend me to thy mistress.
Are you our daughter?
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
To her, widow!
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
Very sweet and contagious, i 'faith.
Hold, worthy lady, hold!
Hark!
Be not afeard.
Get you to bed again.
You are my elder.
Only I yield to die.
Madman and beggar too.
I have not seen him this two days.
Tis new to thee.
O, I die, Horatio.
Where's Antonio, then?
Would?
Make it so known.
Thou art a fool.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
What!
God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.
My curses on her!
Has he, masters?
Is this a holiday?
Why, stay and hear me speak.
What heir of York is there alive but we?
Let me not stay a jot for dinner.
But till that time Come not thou near me.
Marry, your manhood, mew!
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
I am full of pleasure.
Ay, that's the way.
Remember'st thou any that have died on't?
Where is she?
how, I pray?
Caesar, all hail!
Why, anything.
Twill be naught, But let it be.
How long hath she been thus?
My lord, he is but even now gone hence.
Fear me not., She and the duke her husband!
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
I defy lechery.
Yes.
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
Pray ye, sir?
Oh, lay me by my mistress' side.
Prepare you, generals.
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought.
Zounds, sir, you're robbed!
Peter Quince, What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
Quiet thy cudgel.
How have you known the miseries of your father?
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
The Count's gentleman, one Cesario.
They shall be apprehended by and by.
But fare you well.
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
Observe his construction of it.
Die when thou hast lived.
Is it not past two o'clock?
It was his bidding.
Are your doors locked?
Half-blooded fellow, yes.
Come, night.
How say you, sir?
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
What a caterwauling do you keep here!
So am I purposed.
And fixed his eyes upon you?
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Is it four o'clock?
The Moor already changes with my poison.
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
Is it e'en so?
No, Cassius, no.
Shall they see us?
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
All this my sister is, or else should be.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
Here, wear this jewel for me.
Is't lost?
That you must teach me.
I prithee let me hear it.
No, my good knight.
My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was't to you?
