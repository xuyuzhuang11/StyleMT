From the Han to the Tang Dynasty, there was no advocacy of women dying for chastity.
After everything was settled down, he came back slowly and said some words to praise.
It is thought that the relationship between father and son is only one thing of “my father gave birth to me”, and everything owned by the youngsters should belong to the elders.
Therefore, only liberty makes a harmonious family relationship; only if there was no fathers and elder brothers constraining their sons and little brothers, would rebellious sons and little brothers who were against the constraint disappear.
So the biological truth is absolutely not a talisman for polygamy.
There is an unreasonable spirit in the world, and the essence is resilience.
Critics that people asked for have been there for a long time, and now there are many critics.
In fact, even a genius’ first cry at birth is the same as that of an ordinary child, and the cry will never be a good poem.
At that time, my only hope was the collapse of the Leifeng Pagoda. 
Could it be that when he was building the the Pagoda, he failed to expect it to collapse after all.
However, the people of S City seemed not to like taking pictures, because their spirit was to be killed. So when good luck existed, it was not good to take pictures, and the spirit was a "pretty light": all I knew at the time was this.
The most prominent factual example to prove it is Sun Hao. When ruling the Kingdom of Wu, he was so an arrogant and cruel tyrant, but after he surrendered to the Kingdom of Jin, he became a despicable and shameless minion.
Yet the most thorough presentation is “the Picture of Relying on Self”. In the future, if China was to print Drawing the Fundamental Problems of Ethics, this picture was so wonderful to be the illustration that the most greatest caricaturist absolutely cannot imagine and draw.
Tolstoy, Ebson, Rodin were all old, Nietzsche had a fierce look, and Xubenwald had a bitter look. Wilde, when he wore his aesthetic clothes, he was a little dumb. Romain Rolland seemed a little weird, and Gorky looked like a hooligan.
We were in the shadow of amazing germs that subjugate our nation.
It was roughly reasonable that no destruction brought no new construction; but destruction did not necessarily brought new construction.
Looking into mirrors reflected feelings. When I rummaged through my trunk, I found several old bronze mirrors, which were purchased in the early years of the Republic of China in Beijing, which I visited for the first time. “Feelings change as time goes by”, and I had completely forgotten. I looked at them and felt as if they had been from another life in the past.
I was intoxicated by the air of life in China, in the meantime I pondered deeply on the thing that had “charm” to outsiders.
The ancients used women as castles for Gou'an, euphemistically calling it "peace-making marriage", while people of today also use assets and beauties as gifts to show respect as slaves, again euphemistically calling it "assimilation".
Because if we make changes, although it may be beneficial, it also has disadvantages.
The people I remember at that time were the Polish revenge poet A; the Hungarian patriotic poet R; the Philippine literatus L who was killed by the Spanish Government. L’s grandfather was Chinese and Chinese people had translated his swan poems.
But the so-called civilization at that time was indeed a foreign civilization, not quintessence of China; the so-called republic was also an American- or French-style republic, not the republic of the Zhou-Shao republic.
To be more explicit, fear can also prove the cowardice of these people.
But now I'm thinking of another aspect - Chinese literati have never had the courage to face up to life - at least to social phenomena.
Hair is not the same. Some tufts of grey hairs could make the elder look at the mirror and sigh, and quickly pull them out. In the early Qing Dynasty, because of this many people were killed.
Certainly, most of the reason was that they delayed my father’s illness, but I'm afraid it also involved some painful personal resentment.
For example, Liu Baizhao beat and dragged female students from the Women’s Normal University, and Modern Review dared to say nothing about the incident. When the Women's Normal University resumed and Chen Xiying encouraged the female students to occupy the school buildings, Liu said "What if they don't want to leave.”
Literally, it must be something owned only by one country, and other countries do not have. 
But in nowadays’ world if one wants to grow together and earn a position, he is required to have forward-looking intelligence, morals, characters and ideas in order to stand firm: this is a matter of great labor and efforts. 
It is said that there are so many benefits, of which two important ones are listed: first, in sports.
The fatuousness existed from our ancestors to descents; the fatuousness existed from the past to the future.
If the current situation remained unchanged, we could, instead, prosper and live a happy life in real freedom. In that way, it did not hurt to be barbaric.
But we should understand that the equality of personality is also an old foreign ideal; now since the “experience” appeared which is certainly linked to delusion, there should be no distinction between the major and the minor and all should be trampled underfoot. This is in line with the established rules of forefathers.
Take building a railway as an example. If we tell them how beneficial it is, they will take a blind ear; if we, according to a myth, tell them that previously a great immortal pushed a wheelbarrow over the rainbow, and now we imitate him to build a road, then everything can be done.   
Many incidents were gathered together, just as we asked ancients before Sui-jen Shih to run a restaurant. Even if we worked to reconcile, food in the restaurant were just half-cooked; partners did not work cooperatively, so the business would not prosper -- the store would go bankrupt sooner or later.
This was the same as the definition of freedom given by those who were thoughtlessly in favor of and against freedom.
Fire burnt from the north, and people escaped towards the south; broadsword cut from the front, and people stepped back. This was the only model in piles of journal books.

One is that businessmen and the elder people have reprinted dozens of old books to make money, and the other is that great writers in metropolis infested with foreigners have written several Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School novels to publish.
The art circles can receive the tears of writers, while the tears from critics are stains.
However, although I had a feeling of sadness for no reason, I was not resentful, because this experience made me reflect on myself and see myself: I am absolutely not a hero who can easily get response and gather many people.
On summer nights, there were many mosquitoes, so I sat under the locust tree with shaking a cattail fan, looking up at the blue sky through dense leaves. the locust silkworms came out at night often fell on my head or neck, so cold. 
As for myself, I did not want to infect the loneliness that was bitter in my mind to the young people who were similar to the young me, having a good dream.
My elder brother is the most pitiful. He is also a person, so he is afraid, and eats me together.
One wanted to eat people, while was afraid of being eaten. Everyone looked at each other with extremely suspicious eyes.
One day, about two or three days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the shopkeeper was slowly checking out. He took off the chalk board, suddenly saying that it had been a long time since Kong Yiji’s last visit. 
Lao Shuan also seemed to hear that someone was asking him, but he didn't respond; all his focus was on the bag as if he was holding in his arms a baby who was the sole son of a family for ten generations, regardless of any other thing.
He is now going to take the new life in this swaddling clothes to his home, with lots of happiness harvested. 
Xiao Shuan picked up the black thing, and looked at it for a while. It seems that he was holding his own life, and there was something weird but he was unable to say.
Red Nose Lao Gong held a bowl of yellow rice wine, said something and curled his lip towards the wall.
Mistress Shan Si felt a heat on her breasts, and the heat immediately reached her face and ears.
At this time, Red Nose Lao Gong’s ditty was over; he stumbled out of Xian Heng, and raised his voice, singing: my foe!
On entering the room, of all a sudden, there was a person on the handlebar, and fell down slowly.
My mother didn't say anything at all. But when others saw me, they would first study my braid, and when they knew it was fake, they sneered and charged me with beheading; a distant relative of the same clan was ready to file an appeal to the feudal officials, but later he dropped the appeal because of the fear that the revolutionary party's rebellion might be successful.
This incident made me sorrowful, and now I still remember it from time to time.
Among the villagers, he was indeed a famous character.
Through Chinese tallow leaf, Yi saw short and fat Zhao QIye walk from the single-plank bridge wearing a long gown of sapphire blue bamboo cloth. 
The villagers stood blankly, thinking in their mind that they could not defeat Zhang Yide, so they considered that Qi Jin would lose his life.  
Everything was included: rice chickens, Cabot's Tragopan, wood pigeon, Pitta soror. So I was looking forward to snow again.
I have to sell these, and then go. Ah, you have become an official, and how can you say that you are not rich.
He doubled in size; the round purple face  turned sallow and deep wrinkles appeared; his eyes like his father's were swollen and red. I know that those who farm by the sea with sea breeze blowing all day long are probably like this.
He finally had a respectful attitude, and clearly shouted: my lord.
Ah Q is also very arrogant. All the residents of Weizhuang are not in his eyes, and he even shows a look of looking down up the two “literary children”.
He rushed out of the kitchen as if he had been slapped again on his back.
From then on, they knew that he was just a small character. He can neither go up to the wall, nor enter the hole, but only stand outside the hole to pick stuff.
In addition to being proud, he couldn't help shouting loudly: you are rebelling.
Zhao Sichen walked over with an empty head, and the people who saw it shouted that the revolutionary party is coming.
One day, he, as usual, stayed late at night. When the hotel was about to close, he walked back to the Tugu Temple.
Ah Q actually liked watching the scene of bustle and meddling in others’ business, so he went straight in secret.
How could buy rice without money, and how could cook without rice. His cheeks were puffed up, as if annoyed that the answer was "similar" to his argument, almost echoing blankly; then he turned his head away. According to common law, this is an indication that the discussion is suspended.
Mrs. Fang was very surprised and bewildered, thinking that he had already resigned, but when secretly looking at his face, no unfortunate expression could be seen.
He unconsciously turned his lazy body, and walked towards the way home in a daze.
This yard was the one where before his home became so declined, on summer nights, Ye Ye and his grandmother would enjoy the coolness.
It's just that I always thought that there was no spring and autumn; the end of winter and the beginning of summer were next to each other, and then summer just goes and winter begins again.
The moon hadn't set yet, as if it wasn't a long time to watch the play, but as soon as leaving Zhaozhuang, the moonlight seemed amazingly bright.
Really, until now, I really haven't eaten any good bean like that night -- and I haven’t seen any good show like that night anymore.
Anyway, I decided to leave tomorrow.
If there were other intentions, while some other things happened because of this, then I should bear some responsibility for my replies.
The woman took her clothes again, expressing thanks and then walking out.
My heart quivered, and I went to spread them with my hands, very carefully, in order to take a look at my little brother.
The year before last, when I came back to pick up my mother, one day, Chang Fu was at home, and somehow I started chatting with him.
His face was flushed, and it seemed that he was a little drunk, but his eyes darkened.
――Or it is not a must to have international students, those who receive higher education in domestic are also acceptable. 
However, what if the master had no time or energy to talk about literature and art.

In some places, it is impossible to clean with Chinese honey locust alone.
Xuecheng responded with a "yes" in the bottom of his throat, and leave in an attitude of respect.
He was a little sad, and seemed to be like a filial daughter, becoming a lonely person that had no place to tell his own pain.
"I heard that, it's still the same," Fang Tou said, "keeping saying 'put him out, put him out'.
This was just because the light had to be blown out.
His eyes shone even more brightly, firmly staring at Kuoting's eyes, which made Kuoting's eyes quickly shifted.
"Liu Shun in my family," all of a sudden Si Ye said solemnly and sadly, his voice trembling.
"This broken house had nothing to do with me; Liu Shun didn't care about it either.
Public Exhibition, on a road of the west of national capital, there was no hustle and bustle.
"Lao Gan - Old Mr. Gao - hesitated and muttered to himself, but did not speak.
But in the meanwhile, he also heard vaguely Yaopu's words: a water chestnut was given.
He took two steps back, and when he looked closely, a leaning branch lay in front of him, with its leaves trembling slightly after being hit by his head.
These people made me cry bitterly, but most of it was because I was too emotional at the time.
This ridiculous question made me sober. I sat up straight and lit a cigarette; I opened the window and saw that the snow was really falling even harder.
A Five. I went from Shanyang to Licheng, and then to Taigu. After more than half a year during the journey, I finally found nothing to do, so I decided to go back to A city.
In the hall, we had occasional conflicts of discussion and misunderstandings of meaning. Since we arrived at Jizhao Hutong, even this has disappeared. We only sat under the lamp in a reminiscent mood, recalling then rebirth-like interest of conciliation after the conflicts.
In the bureau, he would sit at the desk to copy official documents and letters; at home, he would face her or help her fire a white stove, and cook rice and steamed buns.
I finally found my paradise in popular libraries.
This affair happened at the turn from winter to spring. The wind was not so cold anymore, and I wandered outside for a longer time; by the time I got home, it had been probably already dark.
However, he also urged that he must arrive today.
Not long after he sat down, he suddenly became happy again.
Zhuang Musan greeted as he sat down, leaning his long tobacco pipe over the side of the boat; Ai Gu sat on his left and placed her two hook knife-like feet pointing right at Ba San to form a Chinese character of "eight".
Didn't Master Wei persuade me four times?
"But I heard that at the end of last year, the Shi family organized a banquet for Master Wei, Elderly Ba."
When he thought of this, the scene of the past unfolded before his eyes. Once it came to punish his in-laws, he always smiled coldly, but this time, he didn't. The fat Lord Seven suddenly appeared somehow and made his mind a complete mess.
Sure enough, after a while, she had followed a year-round domestic helper and her father through the hall, and crossed the threshold of the living room after another bend.
When it survived, it would be trampled on or uprooted, until it decayed after dying.
The translation is: my God, why did you abandon me.

In the faint bloodstain - it commemorated the current creator of several dead, living and unborn persons, who was still a coward.
What on the desk was a pot of "Gardenia jasminoides" that I have never seen before: it was a tree. As long as it was submerged in water, its branches and leaves turned green and cute. Looking at the green leaves and editing some old manuscripts, I was finally doing something.
It was afraid that after getting heated, they wrote a letter and put it in the newspaper to advertise: "Look.
The profound meaning of this "logic" was to use my words to prove that I was a dog, so everything I said was completely overturned. Even if I said that two times two and three times three nine, there would be something wrong.
Japanese cats were good at becoming goblins, such as the legendary "cat witches" whose cruelty of cannibalism was indeed even more terrifying.
What girl, I had forgotten now. In short, it was not called Girl Chang; I finally didn't know what her surname was.
Some little incidents happened in my family, and I somehow always suspected that it was linked with this "chattering".
But based on the image in front of my eyes, it was a book with very rough printings.
This book was still there until the year before last, and it was the compact edition of Hao Yixings' version.
"The Biography of a Dutiful Son" written by Shi Jueshou said that "Lao Laizi often wears colorful clothes, fetches drinks for his parents, and falls down when he goes through the hall, fearing to hurt his parents' hearts, thus pretending baby cry ".
Maybe it was because he pulled the polygonum multiflorum to destroy the mud wall, or maybe it was because he threw the bricks to Liang's house on the partition wall, or maybe it was because I jumped down from the stone well railing. We had no way of knowing.
Still leading him into the room, the amah pulled the patient's hand out of the tent.
My father's edema deteriorated day by day, and he would not be able to get up; I have gradually lost faith in the sugar cane that had been in frost for three years, and it seemed that I was not as active in purchasing guiding drug as before.
People in S City were already familiar with each other's faces. As such, even their hearts and livers seemed to be somewhat clear to each other.
I thought I shook my head about twice, and I didn't know which one they saw.

The origin of this "Hundred Filial Piety" was a bit special, because it was made after seeing the "Hundred Beauty New Song" by "Yanzi of Guangdong East".
This was the beginning of being cunning from earnestness.

With legs slightly bent, he held a large black stone with a  spire in his hands - the "Xuan Gui" given by Shun Ye, said repeatedly, "excuse me, excuse me, let me go, let me go", and jostled into the palace from the crowd.
Shu Qi remembered that at noon, they did encounter a few incompetent soldiers who were driving large number of old horses, thin horses, lame horses, and skinny horses, rushing up from behind and almost trampling them to death. Then he asked the old man what the horses were going for.
However, when enjoying the cool air on summer nights, they sometimes talked about their affairs.
He whispered a few times, and at first it worked a little, but then he was simply ignored, and they directly bit with crunching sounds.
He inserted the pine torch into the hole in the earthen wall and looked at it with fun; however, its small round eyes made him hate it, and he stretched out a reed and pressed it to the bottom of the water.
He recently did a little dislike people with red noses.
The other wolves tore off its skin in the first bite, and in the second bite, the whole body disappeared, and the blood stains were licked away in an instant, only the sound of chewing bones heard faintly.

My "Nationality" and "Department".  Although because I persuaded people read less - or not read - Chinese books, I received a letter from an unknown young gentleman asking me to move out of China, I finally did not leave.
Well, it was shown that I thought they were really civilized before.
Or, you would get a charge that was "proud", or "aristocratic".
The same went for people who were "persistent".
It is not a gossip. Mr. Xiying had a indignant look this time. In the Gossip in the 48th issue of Modern Review, he defended for authors whose works were arbitrarily selected to print by booksellers, and thus suffered material damage.
So small-scaled booksellers in Shanghai turned into mosquitoes to suck a little of my blood, which would undoubtedly cause me material damage, but I didn't have any  resentment, because I knew they were mosquitoes, and everyone knew they were mosquitoes.
For example, for a female student, rather than suffering from the secret spreading of some rumors about moral character by some despicable and insidious scholars, it’s better for her to be robbed of a red scarf by bandits—a material.
But it's better to think in your own mind and say it in your own house; or talk to your lover, who could always express her admiration with "Aah" anyhow, and there was no third person to hear about it.
That was because you could not research or create.

I remembered that it was Mr. Xiying who first judged on the basis of "rumors" the Yang Yinyu incident or the trend of Beijing Women Normal University, and that article was in the Modern Review published on May 30th last year.
In recent days, my crime of "fabricating rumors" seemed to be only a flash in the pan. In the main part of "A Bunch of Correspondence", it seemed that did not "flow" me into it, but in the "Xiying to Zhimo" in the back buttocks " was an incidental monograph on me, although it was not a case, but because of kinship, the genocide of the family, or the association of the word prison.
Wasn't it time to talk about "Xiying to Zhimo". It was an extremely dangerous thing. If you were not careful, you would fall into the "quagmire" and encountered "a resentful dog", and you would no longer see "smiling" for the time being.
But I thought that those about other people seemed to be more reasonable.
Although what I wrote was mostly thorns, it also needed peaceful minds.
Now, I heard a massacre carried out in the city of Beijing.
If this were the case, not only before the ruling government, but also across the whole China, nowhere would not be the land of dead.
There were over fifty prisoners in state affairs, which was also a spectacle of the Republic of China; and most of them were teachers. If they were given freedom to escape from Beijing and open a school elsewhere. It would be an interesting thing about the Republic of China.
However, good fortune was often designed for the mediocre. It used the passage of time to wash the old traces, leaving only pale red blood and indifferent sadness.
And it proved that this was not only a killing, but a brutal murder, because there had been scars from sticks on the body.
But this time there were a few surprises for me.
However, there were exceptions to everything in the world, and in terms of things mentioned in the previous section, it also could be regarded as an exception.
Many people and many words were equal to one person and his words.
At that time, the editor of "Morning News Supplement" was "a philosophy of poetry" that had accompanied Mr. Tagore's, nor had the mission to kill others or strangle himself, so he occasionally published articles by laymen like me; At that time, I had no "grievance" with this man who was later called "Mr. Gutong".
If the person who wrote it became a famous person, it also would be printed in spite of his death; the person who read it would also be very interesting, because when he wrote it, he didn't have to put on airs like the "Inner Sense Chapter" and outer coming chapter, people could see the real face of him.
In the morning, I got a letter sent by De Jiye from his hometown with few words, saying that there were patients in the family, and everyone else were in the terror of being attacked by the disease without any precautions; there were a few sighs with emotion at the end.
"I couldn't stand it anymore, and the nasty temper flared up again.
Now that this book could not be borrowed, I had to drop it.
So I could only say: I had no way of determining this.

On the night of March 12, when I was in the crowd, I deeply felt the greatness of revolutionaries.
The general idea is that when you first meet a Chinese, you think that compared to a Japanese or a Westerner, there is something missing on his face. 
Because I thought the reason why the gentlemen invited me was probably that I had written several novels and was a writer, and they wanted to hear literature from me.
I was used to hearing "revolution" here. When it came to the word "revolution" in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, people who listened to it were very scared, and those who talked about it would be endangered.
I remember when the Mongols "entered China", the judgement was translated.
Because this is an irrefutable proof that China's national quintessence must be revived, and it is also a valuable historical material for the future "revitalization of Chinese national culture", I dare not to arbitrarily change the four sentences at the end of the collection "Anthology of Zhaoming" since it is impossible to guess what the "golden army" actually means.
In fact, roughly speaking, it was easy to distinguish.
Another disadvantage was that once you became a teacher, you would have some scruples; a professor needed to put on airs and could not speak freely.
If you only read books, you would become a book chef. Even if you found it interesting, the pleasure was gradually declining and dying.
Taking a step back, the "pro-Communist faction" didn’t succeed in the end.
To put it more bluntly, it is "to be an official".
Certainly, despite this, many were still unhappy, but dare not to say no to cut.

In terms of the reason for the confiscation, it is unknown.
As for "sarcasm", "humor", "irony", "chat", etc., it was really incompatible.
Two months ago, I saw in the newspapers that a certain post office had seized too many publications to store them, and they were all burned.

In this way, when he uses it, he will at least work hard, and explain it first.
When some people want you to drink, even if you don't want to drink, you should not refuse firmly, but hold the politely.
It was nothing more than a mess then, but this time it's a destruction.
Who would portray righteousness and money, and beautify the “bad-looking” of three drops of blood.
So I awakened, struggled, rebelled, and wanted to come out to participate in the world's cause - I wanted to narrow the scope: the industry of literature and art.
The meaning is only to say: he was not "pedantic", because he used a new shape and new color; instead of "Yes" and "No", because he was Chinese after all.
I think it is necessary to measure with the ruler that exists in the hearts of Chinese people who want to participate in the world's business, and only then can we understand his art.
There was not even one paper of palace exam; there were a few other boxes, originally in the Ministry of Education, but all papers in them were second- and third-grade. I heard that the higher-ranking papers had been stolen in the Qing Dynasty, not to mention the best one.
When it returned, the number was often a little less than before. God, it is true.
Although China had characters, it had no connection with people. It used incomprehensible classical Chinese and spoke in outdated ancient meanings. All sound was from the past, and was only useless.
Some said: If people all used the vernacular Chinese, people would not be able to read ancient books, and Chinese culture would perish.
How many of people in China can speak classical Chinese? The rest of them could only speak vernacular Chinese. Were so many Chinese people despicable and worthless?
At that time, I went to the street by chance, went to Dingbu Bookstore by chance, and saw a stack of "Do This" as well as by chance. Then I bought a one.
Just to give a drastic admonition to the second point, roughly saying that since he disapproves of "rigid" and "lively", it means that women should be neither dead nor alive, which was extremely wrong.
